# Flight Route Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing flight routes using datasets obtained from Kaggle, specifically the [Flight Route Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/open-flights/flight-route-database). Our analysis is centered around three major routes: 

1. Delhi (DEL) to Bangalore (BLR)
2. Bangalore (BLR) to Dubai (DXB)
3. Bangalore (BLR) to Mumbai (BOM)

By utilizing this dataset, we aim to extract insights regarding airline competition, flight frequency, and the estimated success rate for potential new routes. This project demonstrates how altering specific parameters can lead to varied outputs, offering a deeper understanding of the aviation market dynamics.

## Objectives

- Analyze flight data for three key routes.
- Visualize the share of flights among competing airlines through pie charts.
- Calculate the probability of success for starting new routes based on existing traffic.
- Estimate ticket costs using competitor data and traffic metrics.

## Key Concepts Learned

Throughout the project, several important concepts were explored:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** 
   - Cleaning the dataset was crucial for accurate analysis. This involved removing any leading/trailing spaces from column names and correcting typographical errors in the dataset. Understanding how to preprocess data effectively is fundamental in data analysis.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Visual representation of data is vital for interpretation. By creating pie charts, we illustrated the market share of different airlines on each route, making the data easily digestible and insightful. The visual outputs enhance understanding and communication of results.

3. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - We calculated the probability of success for potential new routes based on existing flight frequency and competition. This involved deriving metrics that could predict how well a new route might perform in a competitive market.

4. **Geospatial Analysis:**
   - Mapping the flight routes on a geographical plot helped visualize the connections between cities. This aspect added a geographical context to our analysis, showcasing the distance and accessibility between the airports involved.

## Analysis Outputs

The project outputs include various visualizations and metrics that provide insights into the analyzed routes. Below, we outline the key visualizations and their implications:

1. **Pie Charts of Flight Shares:**
   - The pie charts display the share of flights for each airline operating on the routes. This information is critical for understanding market dominance and competition.

2. **Probability of Success and Estimated Ticket Costs:**
   - The calculated probability reflects the chances of successfully launching a new route based on current traffic patterns. This metric helps potential airline operators make informed decisions.
   - Based on the number of competitors and flight frequency, we estimated the average ticket cost for passengers. Understanding pricing strategies in response to competition can inform revenue management for airlines.

## Conclusion

The Flight Route Analysis Project provides valuable insights into the aviation market by analyzing routes between major cities. The use of real-world data from Kaggle allows for a comprehensive understanding of airline competition, flight frequencies, and factors influencing route success. Through data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis, we have gained a deeper understanding of the dynamics at play in the aviation sector.
