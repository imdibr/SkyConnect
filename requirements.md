# Requirements for Flight Route Analysis Project

This `requirements.txt` file lists all the necessary Python packages required to run the Flight Route Analysis Project effectively. 

1. **pandas**: This library is essential for data manipulation and analysis. It allows us to handle structured data easily, making tasks like data cleaning, filtering, and transformation straightforward.

2. **matplotlib**: A powerful plotting library for Python, used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. We utilize matplotlib to generate various charts and graphs for our analysis.

3. **seaborn**: Built on top of matplotlib, seaborn provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics. It enhances the visual appeal of our pie charts and other plots.

4. **numpy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, numpy is used for handling numerical data and performing mathematical operations efficiently.

5. **geopandas**: This library extends pandas to enable spatial operations, allowing us to visualize flight routes on maps.

6. **shapely**: A library for manipulation and analysis of planar geometric objects, used in conjunction with geopandas for route plotting.

To install the required packages, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
